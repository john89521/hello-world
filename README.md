Hello World Git Tutorial
This is a pretty good tutorial, but I think I will need to maybe go through it a couple of times before getting comfortable. 

This is supposed to be the branch, but it really does not give a clear indication if it is. That should be fixed, maybe with a color change, or a flag, etc.
